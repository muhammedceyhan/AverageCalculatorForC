# Average Calculator for C

A simple and efficient C program designed to calculate the running average of a sequence of numbers entered by the user.

## 📝 Description

This application runs in an infinite loop, continuously prompting the user to input integer values. For each entered number, the program:
1. Adds the number to a running total.
2. Increments the count of entries.
3. Instantly calculates and displays the new average with 2 decimal precision.

It's a straightforward tool useful for quick statistical calculations or as a learning example for basic C programming concepts like loops, input/output, and type casting.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

### Compilation
You can compile the source code using `gcc` or any standard C compiler.

**Using GCC:**
```bash
gcc AverageCalculatorForC.c -o AverageCalculator
```

### Running the Application
Once compiled, you can run the executable from your terminal or command prompt.

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\AverageCalculator.exe
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./AverageCalculator
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. Start the program.
2. When prompted `"Type a number for calculate the average:"`, type an integer and press **Enter**.
3. The program will output:
   - The number you just added.
   - The updated average of all numbers entered so far.
4. To stop the program, press `Ctrl+C`.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `AverageCalculatorForC.c`: The main source code file.
- `AverageCalculator.exe`: The compiled executable (generated after build).
